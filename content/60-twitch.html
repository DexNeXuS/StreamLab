  <h1 style="margin-top:10px;">My Twitch setup</h1>
  <p class="dx-content-lead" style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
    Everything I use to go live and why I picked it. Scenes, chat, channel points, audio, overlays, and the custom bits I build or adapt. Commands, schedule, and the DexNeXuS Inventory are linked below; drop in and see what's next.

  <h2 class="dx-heading-reset" style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 8px;">OBS Studio</h2>
  <p class="dx-content-lead" style="margin: 0 0 14px;">
    I use OBS because you can do so much with it. Plugins and scripts extend it in every direction, and being able to control it from external programs Streamer.bot, Touch Portal, browser sources makes the whole setup feel like one system. Scenes, sources, and transitions stay in OBS; everything else talks to OBS so I can focus on the stream.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dx-heading-reset" style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 8px;">Chat, commands & control</h2>
  <ul class="dx-content-list" style="margin: 0 0 14px;">
    <li><strong>Streamer.bot</strong> - Chat commands, channel point rewards, Twitch events, and logic. It drives a lot of the interactive stuff and can trigger OBS, overlays, and other tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Touch Portal</strong> - One-tap buttons on my phone/tablet to switch scenes, run actions, mute mics, and fire Streamer.bot commands. External control done right.</li>
    <li><strong>StreamElements</strong> - Overlays, loyalty, alerts, and the bits that plug straight into Twitch. I run it alongside my own HTML widgets and Streamer.bot so overlays and loyalty stay in sync with the rest of the setup.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="dx-heading-reset" style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 8px;">Audio & voice</h2>
  <p class="dx-content-lead" style="margin: 0 0 14px;">
    <strong>VoiceMeeter</strong> for routing and mixing mics, game audio, music, browser sources and <strong>VoiceMod</strong> for voice effects when I want them. Together they give me clean levels and the option to go full chaos.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dx-heading-reset" style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 8px;">Widgets, HTML & coding</h2>
  <p class="dx-content-lead" style="margin: 0;">
    I build custom HTML widgets and browser sources for overlays, countdowns, and the stuff that doesn’t come out of the box. I also find ideas and widgets online and am always looking for more when I find something good, I implement it as-is or tweak it and make something better. A lot of what’s on this site started as “saw it somewhere, then improved it.” If you’re into that too, the resources and action imports here are there to copy and adapt.

  <p class="dx-muted" style="margin:0;">New tools and widgets show up here and in the nav as I add them.

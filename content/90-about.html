  <p>
    I’m DexNeXuS - builder of systems, player of guitars, and professional overthinker from the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve been playing guitar since I was 15, and it’s still one of the few things that feels like home no matter what’s going on. I’m heavily inspired by bands like CHON, Polyphia, Billy Talent, Sleep Token, Muse, Arcane Roots and System of a Down technical chaos, emotional weight, and riffs that make you question your life choices in the best way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like complexity. In music. In code. In ideas.
    Math-y guitar lines, strange time signatures, layered harmonies that same obsession carries over into how I build things. Whether it’s automation, data systems, or creative projects, I enjoy figuring out how everything connects underneath the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personality-wise? I’m not the loudest in the room. I can be unsociable at times, but I’m always friendly. I prefer depth over noise. Meaningful conversations over small talk. Building something cool over pretending to be cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m into shows and stories that actually have soul Avatar: The Last Airbender and One Peice being some of my favourites. I like worlds that feel lived in. Stuff like Attack on Titan, Death Note, The Rising of the Shield Hero, stories where identity, power, and consequence matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m from the UK and yes, I absolutely dream about living somewhere else one day. Somewhere warmer. Somewhere with more space. Somewhere that doesn’t feel permanently grey.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is where all of that collides music, code, design, experimentation, ambition.
    Some of it is polished. Some of it is evolving. All of it is mine.

# Viewer Placeholder

Shows a static “0 viewers” (or similar) placeholder.

## Quick start

1. **Copy URL** or **Download** and add as an OBS Browser Source.
2. To show a real viewer count, download the file and replace the placeholder with your own logic (e.g. fetch from Twitch API or a local endpoint).

No URL parameters. Edit the HTML/script to wire up your data source.

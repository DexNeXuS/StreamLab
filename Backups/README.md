# Backups

Personal backup storage for stream-related configs and exports. Not part of the public site content — just a place to keep OBS profiles, Streamer.bot exports, Touch Portal pages, etc.

**Folders:** Put your backup files in the right subfolder (e.g. `OBS/`, `Streamerbot/`, `Touch-Portal/`, `VoiceMeeter/`, `VoiceMod/`, `StreamElements/`). You can add more folders if you need them.

**Access:** Use the Backups page on the site (linked from About, or go to `?page=backups`) to open or download files from here.
